# BarCode-creator
To be Honest it sucks when you create account on multiple website just for the barcode and I have to do this because every month our club held atleast 1-2 events and in the poster  we have to Embed G-form for the registration in the form of barcode /Qrcode . Previously we  depends on 3rd party website but after this anyone from our club download the code . replace the url and just run the code .
BOOM!!
Our QRcode is ready no need to create account on any website
Steps In vistar
1)Install these two librabry (Barely their size is 11Mb)
#pip install pyqrcode
#pip install pypng

copy the code and just replace url by your url
