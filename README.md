# BarCode-creator
To be Honest it sucks when you create account on multiple website just for the barcode and I have to do this because every month our club have atleast 2-3 events and for  the registration  we have to add  Google-form  in the form of barcode /Qrcode . Previously we  depends on 3rd party website but from now a big NOO!! 
Now you just need to replace url with you desried url and just run the code .
BOOM!!
Our QRcode is ready no need to create account on any website
Steps are as follow
1)Install these two librabry (Barely their size is 11Mb)
#pip install pyqrcode
#pip install pypng

copy the code and just replace url by your url
